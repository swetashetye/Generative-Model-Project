## Introduction

Generative models are a class of machine learning models that can generate new data samples from the learned distribution of a given dataset. This project demonstrates how to build a GAN to generate images similar to those in the MNIST dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://https://github.com/swetashetye/Generative-Model-Project.git
    cd simple-generative-model
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the training script:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

2. Generated images will be saved in the current directory after each epoch.

## Results

Here are some example images generated by the model during training:
